The northern hemisphere of your planet Earth, where you live, it's covered with an ocean, but on top of that ocean is a sea ice cover. ",7860.242358714977,0.2628401334604834
1003,Sea Ice,neutral,13,32,19,"So when I started my research work in the arctic, and there wasn't much happening, really. It wasn't no big changes going on in the sea ice cover. We never really thought that sea ice would become sort of a fundamental characteristic of our international discourse about global warming and the fact that our planet is warming at a global scale.",7486.817233376226,-0.08605162504903036
1003,Sea Ice,neutral,32,52,20,And we're going to have at some point in the near future no ice in the northern hemisphere in summer. Now that's a very major change that's happened on our planet system. And I work with a whole bunch of scientists from all around the world that study this. And we study the sea ice itself. We also study the connections with glacial ice and the land and all those kind of things.,7222.232886504264,-0.33325325073104695
1003,Sea Ice,neutral,52,80,28,"But when you look at what's happening to the sea ice cover, this change that we have, this reduction, we found recently that this is significant over at least the last 1,450 years. So that includes the last medieval warm period it includes the cold periods before that it includes right up to before the industrial revolution so in fact what we're seeing in the Arctic right now is unique to our time scale of what we're talking about on the planet.",7617.045557587542,0.035620929792094774
1003,Sea Ice,neutral,80,94,14,To do this work we have a whole bunch of tools. One of our largest and most visible tools is the research icebreaker the Amundsen.

1003,Sea Ice,neutral,122,132,10,Now I could talk for a long time about this. I write books about these kind of things. But I wanted to just highlight a few key things that are happening. And these are things that we were surprised about.,7539.497614398764,-0.036832251400212554
1003,Sea Ice,neutral,132,149,17,"First one is, multi-year sea ice is being replaced with very thin first-year sea ice. So multi-year sea ice is really, really thick, really, really hard. And this young stuff is very saline. It's very salty. Remember, it's an ocean that this ice forms on. Even if you were to taste it, you'd spit it out right away because it's really, really salty.",7654.031981377704,0.07017741129671151
1003,Sea Ice,neutral,149,175,26,"The other thing is we're finding crystals in the ice itself called ikaite, which is associated with how CO2 moves through the systems. Up until just recently, we thought the ocean was capped by this ice cover and that CO2 couldn't move between the ocean and the atmosphere. CO2 is the big problem, right? This is what's causing our planet to warm, and we thought that it was decoupled in the Arctic, but we're finding, in fact, it's not. This young sea ice actually plays an active role in exchanging carbon dioxide with the surface.",7178.54681367098,-0.3740692262478328
1003,Sea Ice,neutral,175,186,11,"There are similar processes going on with bromine, mercury, and they're very reactive with the atmosphere, so we're very concerned about what these young ice types mean for the evolution of the Arctic atmosphere.",6458.360521743968,-1.0469405592009253
1003,Sea Ice,neutral,186,210,24,"Snow on sea ice is also very important. Snow falls on the sea ice. When it falls on ice, it's already there. It forms a thick blanket. It insulates that ice, so the ice can't grow as thick as it would have otherwise. If it falls in the open ocean, it does absolutely nothing at all. So what that's doing is it's protecting this multi-year sea ice from growing too thick, which means that it gets thinner and thinner each year because the snow cover doesn't allow it to grow as thick as it used to be.",7531.988669451455,-0.043847872014495505
1003,Sea Ice,neutral,210,232,22,"Of course, this is affecting the animals that live in this environment, in particular polar bears. You've probably heard in the media that polar bears, the sea ice is disappearing. This is an important habitat for the polar bear. So what's going to happen with our polar bears? We have lots of them here in Manitoba. We have lots of them in Canada. Unfortunately, it's not as simple and straightforward as reduction in sea ice means reduction in polar bear habitat. It's much more complicated than that.",7588.394024305562,0.008851751307717877
1003,Sea Ice,neutral,232,246,14,"The big problem is when you remove all the sea ice and you have open water. In those areas, the length of that open water is really important because the polar bears have to go on land and have to be able to forage on the sea ice. They have to wait for it to happen in the fall.",5213.499920011886,-2.2100160326134985
1003,Sea Ice,neutral,246,263,17,"When you look at the rest of the ecosystem in the Arctic, a good way to think about it is that the sea ice acts like the trees in a tropical rainforest. If you're sitting in your seat right now and you think, okay, if we clear cut all the tropical rainforest trees, we can expect there to be an impact on everything in the tropical ecosystem, right? ",6713.232531772063,-0.808813187099515
1003,Sea Ice,neutral,263,275,12,"Well, sea ice plays exactly the same role. If you get rid of all the sea ice, it changes the light environment and the heat environment, which affects everything that lives in the ocean because the ocean has evolved to take advantage of the timing and presence of the sea ice.",7461.609837929612,-0.10960293943055696
1003,Sea Ice,neutral,275,287,12,"So in fact, our research work shows that the change in sea ice is affecting everything in the marine system, right? From the very smallest viruses and bacteria all the way up through the food chain to polar bears, ring seals, those kinds of things. ",6060.918821687872,-1.418271046167472
1003,Sea Ice,neutral,287,300,13,"Another thing we're finding about the ecosystem is that invasive species are becoming a key thing in the Arctic. So on the Atlantic side of the Arctic, we're getting species moving north and displacing the Arctic species. The same's happening on the Pacific side.",5081.841259965705,-2.3330249527681057
1003,Sea Ice,neutral,300,319,19,"The other thing that was surprising to us is just how thick some of the multi-year ice is. It piles up on itself. When it piles up on itself, it can actually get thicker in very localized areas in the Arctic. And so this was a big surprise to us as well. This idea of the ice being able to move faster is also a big hazard.",7964.082706769261,0.3598583552634058
1003,Sea Ice,neutral,319,338,19,"What is the big paradox for us from an ice hazards perspective is one of the things that people are looking at the Arctic for is to increase development. CO2 is the thing that is causing a lot of this issue of our warming planet, yet it is opening up the Arctic for new development. And so people around the planet are interested in developing these resources that are there.",8106.08590270126,0.49253219368748863
1003,Sea Ice,neutral,338,353,15,And of course the big resources are oil and natural gas. There's also lots of minerals and transportation is a big thing but we have to remember that there are hazards that are still there and we need to pay attention to those when we think about how to develop these resources sustainably.,8396.425806877456,0.7637972823491724
1003,Sea Ice,neutral,353,366,13,"It's very important that you remember that you live on planet Earth, and it is a unit. It functions as a unit.
