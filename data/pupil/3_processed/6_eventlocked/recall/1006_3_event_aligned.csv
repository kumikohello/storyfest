Now that's a very major change that's happened on our planet system. And I work with a whole bunch of scientists from all around the world that study this. And we study the sea ice itself. We also study the connections with glacial ice and the land and all those kind of things.,6494.650790019686,0.822742600442673

1006,Sea Ice,neutral,132,149,17,"First one is, multi-year sea ice is being replaced with very thin first-year sea ice. So multi-year sea ice is really, really thick, really, really hard. And this young stuff is very saline. It's very salty. Remember, it's an ocean that this ice forms on. Even if you were to taste it, you'd spit it out right away because it's really, really salty.",6533.021767505156,1.026616945657645
1006,Sea Ice,neutral,149,175,26,"The other thing is we're finding crystals in the ice itself called ikaite, which is associated with how CO2 moves through the systems. Up until just recently, we thought the ocean was capped by this ice cover and that CO2 couldn't move between the ocean and the atmosphere. CO2 is the big problem, right? This is what's causing our planet to warm, and we thought that it was decoupled in the Arctic, but we're finding, in fact, it's not. This young sea ice actually plays an active role in exchanging carbon dioxide with the surface.",6676.398565409093,1.78841277957282

1006,Sea Ice,neutral,186,210,24,"Snow on sea ice is also very important. Snow falls on the sea ice. When it falls on ice, it's already there. It forms a thick blanket. It insulates that ice, so the ice can't grow as thick as it would have otherwise. If it falls in the open ocean, it does absolutely nothing at all. So what that's doing is it's protecting this multi-year sea ice from growing too thick, which means that it gets thinner and thinner each year because the snow cover doesn't allow it to grow as thick as it used to be.",6552.613056197775,1.1307102321953046
1006,Sea Ice,neutral,210,232,22,"Of course, this is affecting the animals that live in this environment, in particular polar bears. You've probably heard in the media that polar bears, the sea ice is disappearing. This is an important habitat for the polar bear. So what's going to happen with our polar bears? We have lots of them here in Manitoba. We have lots of them in Canada. Unfortunately, it's not as simple and straightforward as reduction in sea ice means reduction in polar bear habitat. It's much more complicated than that.",6487.097392308828,0.782609559447495
1006,Sea Ice,neutral,232,246,14,"The big problem is when you remove all the sea ice and you have open water. In those areas, the length of that open water is really important because the polar bears have to go on land and have to be able to forage on the sea ice.

1006,Sea Ice,neutral,263,275,12,"Well, sea ice plays exactly the same role. If you get rid of all the sea ice, it changes the light environment and the heat environment, which affects everything that lives in the ocean because the ocean has evolved to take advantage of the timing and presence of the sea ice.",6609.166439653672,1.431192127036997

1006,Sea Ice,neutral,300,319,19,"The other thing that was surprising to us is just how thick some of the multi-year ice is. It piles up on itself. When it piles up on itself, it can actually get thicker in very localized areas in the Arctic. And so this was a big surprise to us as well. This idea of the ice being able to move faster is also a big hazard.",6457.29762276121,0.6242761287607695
