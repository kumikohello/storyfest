And this was pretty much, I was defined by whatever phase I was in. And these phases would be like TV shows or books or something that I just become obsessed with and devote my entire existence to and then have that whole thing completely shift in like a week.

It was this new world. It was suburbia. It was staying up late and going to the mall. And there was a pool table and a ping pong table and a pool for the pool party.,1883.958472394675,-0.17861024894491379

He was the adult who would actually pay attention to my brother and I when we were little. All the other adults would just come up to us and be like, wow, you grew up so quickly.

1001,Sea Ice,neutral,408,428,20,And we're going to have at some point in the near future no ice in the northern hemisphere in summer. Now that's a very major change that's happened on our planet system. And I work with a whole bunch of scientists from all around the world that study this. And we study the sea ice itself. We also study the connections with glacial ice and the land and all those kind of things.,2067.8115848275343,0.5049707817074968

1001,Sea Ice,neutral,508,525,17,"First one is, multi-year sea ice is being replaced with very thin first-year sea ice. So multi-year sea ice is really, really thick, really, really hard.

1001,Sea Ice,neutral,525,551,26,"The other thing is we're finding crystals in the ice itself called ikaite, which is associated with how CO2 moves through the systems. Up until just recently, we thought the ocean was capped by this ice cover and that CO2 couldn't move between the ocean and the atmosphere. CO2 is the big problem, right? This is what's causing our planet to warm, and we thought that it was decoupled in the Arctic, but we're finding, in fact, it's not. This young sea ice actually plays an active role in exchanging carbon dioxide with the surface.",2041.8666250939398,0.4085052822648231

1001,Sea Ice,neutral,562,586,24,"Snow on sea ice is also very important. Snow falls on the sea ice. When it falls on ice, it's already there. It forms a thick blanket. It insulates that ice, so the ice can't grow as thick as it would have otherwise. If it falls in the open ocean, it does absolutely nothing at all. So what that's doing is it's protecting this multi-year sea ice from growing too thick, which means that it gets thinner and thinner each year because the snow cover doesn't allow it to grow as thick as it used to be.",703.5159662130161,-4.5675928140143665
