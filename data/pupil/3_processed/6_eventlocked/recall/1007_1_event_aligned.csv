1007,Sea Ice,neutral,508,525,17,"First one is, multi-year sea ice is being replaced with very thin first-year sea ice. So multi-year sea ice is really, really thick, really, really hard. And this young stuff is very saline. It's very salty. Remember, it's an ocean that this ice forms on. Even if you were to taste it, you'd spit it out right away because it's really, really salty.",5584.108396506228,0.520255867538798
1007,Sea Ice,neutral,525,551,26,"The other thing is we're finding crystals in the ice itself called ikaite, which is associated with how CO2 moves through the systems. Up until just recently, we thought the ocean was capped by this ice cover and that CO2 couldn't move between the ocean and the atmosphere. CO2 is the big problem, right? This is what's causing our planet to warm, and we thought that it was decoupled in the Arctic, but we're finding, in fact, it's not. This young sea ice actually plays an active role in exchanging carbon dioxide with the surface.",5571.6532087603355,0.47310677211170465

1007,Sea Ice,neutral,562,586,24,"Snow on sea ice is also very important. Snow falls on the sea ice. When it falls on ice, it's already there. It forms a thick blanket. It insulates that ice, so the ice can't grow as thick as it would have otherwise. If it falls in the open ocean, it does absolutely nothing at all. So what that's doing is it's protecting this multi-year sea ice from growing too thick, which means that it gets thinner and thinner each year because the snow cover doesn't allow it to grow as thick as it used to be.",5864.295919112894,1.5809053342816124
1007,Sea Ice,neutral,586,608,22,"Of course, this is affecting the animals that live in this environment, in particular polar bears. You've probably heard in the media that polar bears, the sea ice is disappearing. This is an important habitat for the polar bear. So what's going to happen with our polar bears? We have lots of them here in Manitoba. We have lots of them in Canada. Unfortunately, it's not as simple and straightforward as reduction in sea ice means reduction in polar bear habitat.

1007,Sea Ice,neutral,608,622,14,"The big problem is when you remove all the sea ice and you have open water.

1007,Sea Ice,neutral,676,695,19,"The other thing that was surprising to us is just how thick some of the multi-year ice is. It piles up on itself. When it piles up on itself, it can actually get thicker in very localized areas in the Arctic. And so this was a big surprise to us as well. This idea of the ice being able to move faster is also a big hazard.",5450.75173397377,0.015434411944514092
