Why would Natalie, haunted by her mother's gypsy prophecy, willingly climb into a dinghy alone? Not to mention the bruises and the marks on her thighs and shins, suggesting a struggle, as if she'd been resisting something or someone, pushing or pulling her toward the water. Add to that, the wounds on her neck and head, possibly from being struck hard enough to lose consciousness. And a broken fingernail, a small haunting detail that hinted she may have clawed desperately to save her life.

It insulates that ice, so the ice can't grow as thick as it would have otherwise. If it falls in the open ocean, it does absolutely nothing at all. So what that's doing is it's protecting this multi-year sea ice from growing too thick, which means that it gets thinner and thinner each year because the snow cover doesn't allow it to grow as thick as it used to be.",2331.4961432321243,-0.9415114264842234
